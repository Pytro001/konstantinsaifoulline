            <h3>Origins</h3>
            <p>Born in Germany, growing up in a small town called Dresden, I developed my first musical skills playing instruments and Lego all day long. One of my biggest advantages are my always caring mother and father that shaped my first years growing up.</p>

            <h3>First Golden Plate</h3>
            <p>After posting some remixes on TikTok in 2023, 'Blonde Chaya' with Niklas Dee went viral, giving me Gold status with over 100M streams on one song in collaboration with Universal Music. While still finishing high school, I played regular shows across Europe, collaborating with influencers and DJs and hosting my own events.</p>
